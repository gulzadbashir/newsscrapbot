India Rejects Canada's Suspicions on Role in Sikh Leader's Murder
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/index.php/world-185164,"Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said authorities were ""actively pursuing credible allegations"" linking New Delhi's agents to the murder of a Sikh separatist leader, a concern India dismissed as ""absurd"".,
,The spat deals a fresh blow to diplomatic ties that have been fraying for years, with New Delhi unhappy over Sikh separatist activity in Canada. It now ,threatens, trade ties too, with talks on a proposed trade deal frozen last week.,
,Each nation also expelled a diplomat in tat-for-tat moves, with Canada throwing out India's top intelligence agent there while New Delhi responded by giving a Canadian diplomat five days to leave.,
,Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen was ""an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty"", Trudeau told the House of Commons in an ,emergency statement, on Monday.,
,He was referring to Hardeep Singh Nijjar, 45, shot dead outside a Sikh temple on June 18 in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population, three years after India had designated him as a ""terrorist"".,
,Nijjar supported a Sikh homeland in the form of an independent, so-called state of Khalistan in India's northern state of Punjab, the birthplace of the Sikh religion, which borders Pakistan.,
,On Tuesday, India's foreign ministry said it had given the Canadian diplomat five days to leave the country, without disclosing his name or rank.,
,""The decision reflects the government of India's growing concern at the interference of Canadian diplomats in our internal matters and their involvement in anti-India activities,"" it said in a statement.,
,The ministry had summoned Cameron MacKay, Canada's high commissioner, or ambassador, in New Delhi to notify him of the move, it added.,
,Earlier, New Delhi urged Ottawa to take action against anti-Indian elements in Canada.,
,""Allegations of the government of India's involvement in any act of violence in Canada are absurd and motivated,"" it said, adding that similar accusations made by Trudeau to Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been ""completely rejected"".,
,It said the ""unsubstantiated allegations"" sought to shift focus away from ""Khalistani terrorists and extremists who have been provided shelter in Canada"".,
,'PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE ACTION',
,The ministry added, ""We urge the government of Canada to take prompt and effective legal action against all anti-India elements operating from their soil,"" the ministry said.,
,Trudeau said he had raised the matter directly with Modi on the sidelines of G20 summit in New Delhi on Sept. 9 and 10, and had urged his government to co-operate with Canada to resolve it.,
,Modi, in turn, ,conveyed, strong concern to Trudeau over recent demonstrations in Canada by Sikhs calling for an independent state.,
,Canada has the largest population of Sikhs outside the Indian state of Punjab, with about 770,000 people reporting Sikhism as their religion in the 2021 census.,
,Khalistan is an independent Sikh state whose creation has been sought for decades. A Sikh insurgency killed tens of thousands of people in India in the 1980s and early 1990s before it was suppressed by tough security action.,
,However, New Delhi has been wary of any revival, with a particular focus on small groups of Sikhs in Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States, who support the separatist demand and occasionally stage protests outside its embassies.,
,The United States and Australia expressed ""deep concern"" over Canada’s accusations, while Britain said it was in close touch with its Canadian partners about the ""serious allegations"".,
,India has been particularly sensitive to Sikh protesters in Canada with some Indian analysts saying Ottawa does not stop them as Sikhs are a politically influential group there.,
,In June, India criticised Canada for permitting a float in a parade depicting the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her bodyguards, perceived to be glorification of violence by Sikh separatists.,
,Ottawa paused talks this month on a proposed trade treaty with India, just three months after both said they aimed to seal an initial deal this year.,
,Modi did not hold a two-way meeting with Trudeau at the G20 summit, despite similar meetings with other world leaders. Days earlier, metro stations in the Indian capital were vandalised with pro-Khalistan graffiti.,

Afghanistan Crushes Bangladesh in 2nd ODI and Clinches Series
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/index.php/sport-184109,"(AP) — Openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran hit centuries as Afghanistan trounced Bangladesh by 142 runs in the second one-day international and secured the series on Saturday.,
,Gurbaz’s career-best 145 off 125 balls included 13 fours and eight sixes while Zadran made an exact 100 and shared 256 runs for the opening stand, Afghanistan’s highest partnership for any wicket.,
,After that stand, which surpassed the previous best of 218 against Scotland in 2010, Afghanistan lost nine wickets for 75 before putting up 331-9, its highest total against Bangladesh and third largest total in its history.,
,Bangladesh, which lost the first rain-affected match by 17 runs, was bowled out for 189 in 43.2 overs with Ebadbot Hossain unable to bat due to a muscle strain.,
,The 142-run defeat was Bangladesh’s largest by runs to Afghanistan, and only the third ODI series defeat at home since 2015.,
,“Our openers batted really well but it was not an easy wicket to bat on. But it was a good total,” Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi said.,
,“From the last series, our bowlers were not bowling in the right areas. We were in Abu Dhabi before this series and worked hard on our game. We have worked hard for the last two years to build this team and hopefully our performance in the Asia Cup and World Cup will be good.”,
,Mushfiqur Rahim, on his 250th ODI, led Bangladesh with 69.,
,Liton Das, leading the side in the absence of Tamim Iqbal, decided to bowl first and it backfired to the local fans’ dismay.,
,Gurbaz got off the mark with a graceful cover drive off Mustafizur Rahman in the opening over.,
,The Bangladesh bowlers were erratic, giving away 33 extras, bowled too short to Gurbaz and failed to trouble Zadran.,
,After hitting eight fours and six sixes, Gurbaz raised his fourth century off exactly 100 balls, tucking a delivery off left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan toward midwicket for a single.,
,His next 45 runs came off just 24 balls before Shakib had him leg before with a delivery that kept low. Gurbaz reviewed in vain but his 145 is Afghanistan’s second highest in ODIs.,
,Zadran reached his fourth century, off 118 balls, driving Mustafizur to sweeper cover for a single.,
,Shakib, with 2-50, was the only bowler to concede less than 6 runs per over as they strangled the rest of the lineup after the openers were dislodged.,
,“We were not up to the mark in the field and with the ball,” Liton said. “The way Gurbaz and Ibrahim batted, credit goes to them. After they departed, it was a different ball game, the bowlers bowled well.,
,“As an opener, if you bat like 20-25 overs, it is not difficult but you have to control yourself to not give wickets in the powerplay because they have good quality bowlers.”,
,Pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi, who claimed 3-24 in the first ODI, took 3-22 in this match.,
,He dismissed captain Liton Das (13) and Mohammad Naim (9), who replaced Tamim Iqbal, to give Afghanistan early advantage.,
,Off-spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman spun one sharply to get the better of the in-form Najmul Hossain at 25-3.,
,Shakib and Towhid Hridoy resisted briefly but the introduction of leg-spinner Rashid Khan hastened the collapse as Bangladesh lost three wickets for seven runs to be left on 72-6.,
,Mushfqiur Rahim and Mehidy Hasan combined for an 87-run stand before Mujeeb dismissed Hasan for 25 and ended with 3-40.,
,Farooqi broke Mushfiqur’s stubborn resistance and Afghanistan had an unassailable 2-0 series lead.,
,The final ODI is on Tuesday.,

Ruthless India Rout Sri Lanka to Win Asia Cup as Paceman Siraj Shines
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/index.php/sport-185135,"India lifted the Asia Cup after routing defending champions Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the final with Mohammed Siraj claiming a career-best 6-21, including four wickets in one over, at the R Premadasa Stadium on Sunday.,
,Electing to bat, Sri Lanka were bundled out for a paltry 50 in 15.2 overs with five batters getting ducks in their sorry-looking scorecard with Siraj the wrecker-in-chief.,
,Siraj's fiery display of pace bowling was best illustrated in his second over when the right-arm quick dismissed Pathum Nissanka, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka and Dhananjaya de Silva.,
,Hardik Pandya bagged three wickets while Jasprit Bumrah claimed one as Sri Lanka registered their second lowest total in one-day internationals, lasting only 92 balls.,
,India needed 6.1 overs to achieve the target for a timely boost before their home World Cup beginning next month.,
,""It's like a dream,"" Siraj, who became only the fourth bowler to take four wickets in an over in ODIs, said after the Sri Lanka innings.,
,""I got four early wickets last time I played Sri Lanka (earlier this year) but unfortunately I could not register a five-wicket haul.,
,""I realised you get whatever is in your destiny. I just tried to bowl my line and length, and wickets kept coming.,
,""The ball did not swing much in the early matches here but today it swung a lot. My effort was to draw the batters forward and make them play the ball."",
,Bumrah removed Kusal Perera in the first over to trigger a collapse and the Sri Lanka batters looked helpless as Siraj breathed fire with the new ball.,
,Only Kusal Mendis (17) and Dushan Hemanta, who made 13 not out, managed double digits for the home side.,
,India skipper Rohit Sharma held himself back and sent out Ishan Kishan to open the innings with Shubman Gill, opting for a left-right opening stand.,
,The openers scored freely to ensure there was no drama and Kishan, who made 23 not out, scored the winning run of the summit clash, which lasted only 21.3 overs.,
,Gill, the tournament's leading scorer, remained unbeaten on 27.,
,Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood bemoaned his team's ""below-par"" performance with the bat.,
,""The way we got dismissed is very disappointing. I think there's a lot of reflection to be done in the dressing room,"" he said.,
,""I thought Siraj was superb ... the Indian bowlers made our life difficult but, at the same time, I think we made our own life difficult as well."",
,India host Australia in a three-match ODI series later this match and the teams will clash again on Oct. 8 in their World Cup opener in Chennai.,

Iran’s President Denies Sending Drones to Russia
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/world-185163,"(AP) — Iran’s president on Monday denied his country had sent drones to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine, even as the United States accuses Iran of not only providing the weapons but helping Russia build a plant to manufacture them.,
,“We are against the war in Ukraine,” President Ebrahim Raisi said as he met with media executives on the sidelines of the world’s premier global conference, the high-level leaders’ meeting at the U.N. General Assembly.,
,The Iranian leader spoke just hours after five Americans who had been held in Iranian custody arrived in Qatar, freed in a deal that saw President Joe Biden agree to unlock nearly $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets.,
,Known as a hard-liner, Raisi seemingly sought to strike a diplomatic tone. He reiterated offers to mediate the Russia-Ukraine war despite being one of the Kremlin’s strongest backers. And he suggested that the just-concluded deal with the United States that led to the prisoner exchange and assets release could “help build trust” between the longtime foes.,
,Raisi acknowledged that Iran and Russia have long had strong ties, including defense cooperation. But he denied sending weapons to Moscow since the war began. “If they have a document that Iran gave weapons or drones to the Russians after the war,” he said, then they should produce it.,
,Iranian officials have made a series of contradictory comments about the drones. U.S. and European officials say the sheer number of Iranian drones being used in the war in Ukraine shows that the flow of such weapons has not only continued but intensified after hostilities began.,
,Despite his remarks about trust, Raisi’s tone toward the United States wasn’t all conciliatory; he had harsh words at other moments.,
,Raisi said his country “sought good relations with all neighboring countries” in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.,

Meta Takes Aim at Twitter With the Launch of Rival App Threads
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/index.php/science-technology-184069,"Meta unveiled an app to rival Twitter on Wednesday, appearing to target users looking for an alternative to the social media platform owned — and frequently changed — by Elon Musk.,
,Called Threads, the new offering is billed as a text-based version of Meta’s photo-sharing app Instagram that the company says provides “a new, separate space for real-time updates and public conversations.”,
,The app went live just after midnight Wednesday in the U.K. in Apple and Google Android app stores in more than 100 countries including the U.S., Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan. Early celebrity users include chef Gordon Ramsay, the pop star Shakira and Mark Hoyle, better known as the YouTuber LadBaby.,
,Users get a Twitter-like microblogging experience, according to screenshots provided to media, suggesting that Meta Platforms has been gearing up to directly challenge the platform after Musk’s tumultuous ownership has resulted in a series of unpopular changes that have turned off users and advertisers.,
,There are buttons to like, repost, reply to or quote a “thread,” and counters showing the number of likes and replies that a post has received.,
,“Our vision is that Threads will be a new app more focused on text and dialogue, modeled after what Instagram has done for photo and video,” the company said.,
,Posts are limited to 500 characters, which is more than Twitter’s 280-character threshold, and can include links, photos and videos up to five minutes long.,
,Instagram users will be able to log in with their existing usernames and follow the same accounts on the new app. New users will have to set up an Instagram account.,
,Meta emphasized measures to keep users safe, including enforcing Instagram’s community guidelines and providing tools to control who can mention or reply to users.,
,Meta’s new offering, however, has raised data privacy concerns.,
,Threads could collect a wide range of personal information, including health, financial, contacts, browsing and search history, location data, purchases and “sensitive info,” according to its data privacy disclosure on the App Store.,
,Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey pointed it out in a snarky tweet saying, “All your Threads are belong to us” that included a screenshot of the disclosure. Musk replied “yeah.”,
,One place Threads won’t be rolled out is in the European Union, which has strict data privacy rules.,
,Meta has informed Ireland’s Data Privacy Commission that it has no plans yet to launch Threads in the 27-nation bloc, commission spokesman Graham Doyle said. The Irish watchdog is Meta’s main privacy regulator for the EU because the company’s regional headquarters is based in Dublin.,
,While Meta had teased Threads with a listing on Apple’s U.K. App Store earlier this week, it could not be found in the French, German or Dutch versions. The company is working on rolling the app out to more countries but cites regulatory uncertainty for its decision to hold off on a European launch.,
,Analysts said its success is far from guaranteed, citing Meta’s track record of starting standalone apps that were later shut down.,
,Also in question is whether it’s the right move for Meta, which has announced tens of thousands of layoffs over the past year amid a tech industry slowdown.,
,CEO Mark Zuckerberg also has been focusing on the metaverse, investing tens of billions of dollars in the virtual reality concept.,
,Meta risks “spreading itself too thin,” said Mike Proulx, a research director at Forrester, a global market research company. “Meta is banking on a moment in time amidst peak Twitter frustration. However, this window of opportunity is already flooded with Twitter alternatives including Bluesky, Mastodon, Spill, Post.News and Hive, which are all competing for Twitter’s market share.”,
,Even so, Threads could be a fresh headache for Musk, who acquired Twitter last year for $44 billion.,
,He’s made a series of changes that have triggered backlash, the latest being daily limits on the number of tweets people can view to try to stop unauthorized scraping of potentially valuable data. He also is now requiring paid verification for users to access the online dashboard TweetDeck.,

Bird Has Flown as Musk, Twitter CEO Yaccarino Say 'X' Logo is Here
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/science-technology-184332,"(Reuters) - Elon Musk and Twitter Chief Executive Officer Linda Yaccarino unveiled a logo for the social media platform on Monday that featured a white ""X"" on a black background as a replacement for the familiar blue bird symbol.,
,""X is here! Let's do this,"" tweeted Yaccarino, and also posted a picture of the logo projected on the company's offices in San Francisco.,
,Both Yaccarino's and Musk's Twitter handles feature the X logo, although the Twitter blue bird is still visible across the platform.,
,Musk said on a post on Sunday he wanted to change Twitter's logo and polled his millions of followers whether they would favour changing the site's colour scheme from blue to black.,
,He posted a picture of a stylised X against a black outer space-themed background. He also referred to the ""interim X logo"".,
,Yaccarino, the former advertising chief at NBCUniversal who started as Twitter CEO on June 5, has taken over when the social media platform is trying to reverse a plunge in advertising revenue.,

Op-Ed: World Food Day 2021
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/opinion-175047,"This year’s World Food Day finds us at a critical moment. The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global challenge, causing untold losses and hardship. The impacts of the climate crisis are all around us. Crops have gone up in flames. Homes have been washed away. Lives and livelihoods have been thrown into turmoil due to conflict and other humanitarian emergencies. Global food security challenges have not been this severe for years. ,
,Yet in the midst of this all, there is an encouraging new momentum and energy building as we strive to overhaul the ways in which our food is produced, stored, distributed and consumed. We have started confronting the problems and making the structures more fit for purpose. ,
,Last month’s UN Food Systems Summit convened by the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, mapped out the broad outlines of how the world needs to move forward to transform agri-food systems. ,
,The closing maxim of the gathering was: “From New York back to Rome,” where the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and sister UN food agencies are based.  ,
,We at FAO have already rolled up our sleeves and got down to the practical tasks of leading the implementation and driving the transformation. ,
,A groundbreaking World Food Forum was successfully convened here in the Italian capital early this month, powered by the global youth, and youth representatives at FAO and our sister agencies, focused on harnessing the creativity and resilience of our younger generations. They have the most at stake. They will be the ones living with the direct consequences of the climate crisis and malfunctioning agri-food systems. At the same time, the 1.8 billion young people in the world today between the ages of 10 and 24, of which nearly 90 percent are living in developing countries, provide an unlimited potential to tap. ,
,We have already started to leverage that into widespread awareness, holistic solutions and concrete youth-lead actions for change. Of course the young aren’t the only ones who need to worry about our agri-food systems not being fit for purpose, and on how to make them more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable. ,
,Even before COVID-19 shone a spotlight on the vulnerability of the world’s agri-food systems, hundreds of millions of people worldwide were afflicted by hunger - and that number has increased in the last year up to 811 million. Despite the world producing sufficient food to feed all of us. This is unimaginable and unacceptable. ,
,At the same time, 14 percent of the food we produce is lost, and 17 percent is wasted. Combine this with other stressors — such as pests and diseases, natural disasters, loss of biodiversity and habitat destruction, and conflict  — and you can see the magnitude of the challenge we face in meeting the world’s growing food needs, while simultaneously reducing the environmental and climate impact of our agri-food systems.  ,
,FAO, as the leading agency working on food and agriculture, has developed a toolbox which we are confident can enable us to make an impact on many of these complex systemic problems. ,
,We have a clear sense of where we are going, framed in the objectives: Better Production, Better Nutrition, a Better Environment and a Better Life. And our work is underpinned by a new Strategic Framework 2022-2031 for the next ten years that defines the concrete actions and inputs needed to make the Four Betters a reality, and leave no one behind. ,
,FAO estimates that as much as $40 to $50 billion in annual investments on targeted interventions are needed to end hunger by 2030. There are plenty of low-cost, high-impact projects that can help hundreds of millions of people better meet their food needs. ,
,For instance, targeted interventions on Research and Development to make farming more technologically advanced, innovation in digital agriculture, and improve literacy rates among women can go a long way to reducing hunger. But there are also other essential elements such as better data, governance and institutions, that need to be added to the equation. ,
,In addition, our approach can only be effective if it’s rooted in working together with governments, and key partners, as they forge their own national pathways towards transformation in line with their specific conditions and needs. ,
,We also need to realize that scientists and bureaucrats and even food producers and distributors will never be able to bring about all these desperately needed changes on their own. ,
,The transformation can and must start with pragmatic and concrete action by ordinary consumers and the choices we make. The decisions we make every day on the foods we consume, where we buy them, how they are packaged, how much food we throw away – all these have an impact on our agri-food systems and the future of this planet.  ,
,All of us have the potential to be food heroes. Our actions are our future. The process of transforming our agri-food systems - and making an impact on global hunger, healthy diets, environmental damage and waste - starts with you and me.  ,
,But it doesn’t end with you and me. The old adage goes: “We are what we eat.” It also holds true that how our children and grandchildren develop will also be influenced by what we eat. Hope is in their hands to carry on. Let us learn together, work together and contribute together. ,

,Copies of manuscripts decorated with gold and lapis lazuli, historical documents, Shah Abdul Rahman Khan's wardrobe, desks, and chairs, attract the attention of every newcomer. ,

Microsoft Under Fire After Hacks of US State and Commerce Departments
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/index.php/science-technology-184187," (Reuters) - In late June, one of cybersecurity expert Steven Adair's clients got an alert from Microsoft: one of the client's employees working on human rights issues had their email account compromised. The client wanted to know if Adair could get to the bottom of it.,
,Adair, who used to work in cyberdefense at the U.S. space agency NASA before setting up his own firm, Volexity, immediately launched an investigation - and hit a brick wall.,
,""We pored over every detail related to this user's behavior,"" Adair told Reuters on Thursday. ""We couldn't turn up anything."",
,The hackers who broke into his client's emails were the same set of sophisticated cyber spies Microsoft MSFT.O this week blamed for stealing emails from senior U.S. officials, including State Department employees and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Microsoft said the hacks worked not by hijacking computers or stealing passwords but by taking advantage of a still-undisclosed security issue with the company's ubiquitous online email service.,
,Because Adair's client - whom he declined to identify - was not paying Microsoft for its premium security suite, detailed forensic data was unavailable and Adair had no way to figure out what had happened.,
,""We basically became a spectator at that point,"" he said.,
,Adair is now pushing for Microsoft to provide the additional data to its clients free of charge, a campaign that has picked up steam in the wake of the breach amid disquiet with the software giant's security practices in government circles.,
,U.S. Senator Ron Wyden said Microsoft should offer all its customers full forensic capabilities, saying that ""charging people for premium features necessary to not get hacked is like selling a car and then charging extra for seatbelts and airbags."",
,Microsoft did not immediately return messages seeking comment on Adair's experience, Wyden's comment, or other criticism of its security.,
,In a blog post that first outlined the hack late on Tuesday, Microsoft said that ""accountability starts with us"" and that it was ""continually self-evaluating, learning from incidents"" and strengthening its defenses.,
,A STORM IN THE CLOUD,
,For years individuals, organizations and governments have been moving their emails, spreadsheets and other data off their own servers and on to Microsoft's, taking advantage of cost savings and the integration with the Redmond, Washington-based company's suite of office tools. At the same time, Microsoft has promoted the use of its own security products, prompting some clients to abandon what they saw as redundant antivirus programs.,
,The process of migrating an organization's data and services to a big tech firm is sometimes called ""moving to the cloud."" It can boost security, especially for small organizations that lack the resources to run their own IT or security departments.,
,But competitors squeezed by Microsoft's security offering are sounding the alarm over how wide swaths of industry and government were effectively putting all their eggs in one basket.,
,""Organizations need to invest in security,"" Adam Meyers of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike said in an email distributed to journalists on Wednesday. ""Having one monolithic vendor that is responsible for all of your technology, products, services and security can end in disaster."",
,Frustration is also building with Microsoft's licensing structure, which charges customers extra for the ability to see detailed forensic logs like the ones Volexity's Adair could not access. The issue has been a point of contention between the company and U.S. government ever since a hack of business software company SolarWinds (SWI.N) was disclosed in 2020.,
,Adair said he understood that Microsoft wanted to make money from its premium security product. But he said having more eyes open to cyberthreats would be a win-win for the company and its customers. He noted that the hackers - which Microsoft nicknames Storm-0558 - were caught only because someone at the State Department with access to Microsoft's top-of-the-line logging noticed an anomaly in their forensic data.,
,""Having Microsoft further empower customers and security companies so they can work together is probably the best way,"" Adair said.,

Musk Says Twitter Will Limit How Many Tweets Users Can Read
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/index.php/afghanistan-184013,"(Reuters) - Twitter is limiting how many tweets per day various accounts can read, to discourage ""extreme levels"" of data scraping and system manipulation, Executive Chair Elon Musk said in a post on the social media platform on Saturday.,
,Verified accounts were initially limited to reading 6,000 posts a day, Musk said, adding that unverified accounts will be limited to 600 posts a day with new unverified accounts limited to 300.,
,The temporary reading limitation was later increased to 10,000 posts per day for verified users, 1,000 posts per day for unverified and 500 posts per day for new unverified users, Musk said in a separate post without providing further details.,
,Previously, Twitter had announced it will require users to have an account on the social media platform to view tweets, a move that Musk on Friday called a ""temporary emergency measure."",
,Musk had said that hundreds of organizations or more were scraping Twitter data ""extremely aggressively"", impacting user experience.,
,Musk had earlier expressed displeasure with artificial intelligence firms like OpenAI, the owner of ChatGPT, for using Twitter's data to train their large language models.,
,Twitter was down for thousands of users on Saturday morning, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.,
,Nearly 7,500 users across the social media platform reported issues with accessing the app during the peak of the outage at around 11:17 AM ET.,
,The social media platform had previously taken a number of steps to win back advertisers who left Twitter under Musk's ownership and to boost subscription revenue by making verification check marks a part of the Twitter Blue program.,

US Secret Arms Deal With Pakistan Played Role in IMF Bailout: Report
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/world-185148,"The Intercept reported that the “secret Pakistani arms sales to US helped to facilitate a controversial bailout from the International Monetary Fund earlier this year, according to two sources with knowledge of the arrangement, with confirmation from internal Pakistani and American government documents.”,
,The arms sales, The Intercept said, “were made for the purpose of supplying the Ukrainian military — marking Pakistani involvement in a conflict it had faced US pressure to take sides on."",
,The report said that in April 2022, the Pakistani military, with the encouragement of the US, helped organize a no-confidence vote to remove Prime Minister Imran Khan.,
,According to the Intercept, ahead of the ouster, “State Department diplomats privately expressed anger to their Pakistani counterparts over what they called Pakistan’s aggressively neutral stance on the Ukraine war under Khan."" “They warned of dire consequences if Khan remained in power and promised all would be forgiven if he was removed,” the report reads.,
,The Intercept says that since Khan’s ouster, “Pakistan has emerged as a useful supporter of the US and its allies in the war, assistance that has now been repaid with an IMF loan.”,
,“The emergency loan allowed the new Pakistani government to put off a looming economic catastrophe and indefinitely postpone elections — time it used to launch a nationwide crackdown on civil society and jail Khan,” the report reads.,
,The Intercept said that a spokesperson at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington declined to comment and referred the question to the US Department of State.,
,“Negotiations over the IMF review were a matter for discussion between Pakistan and IMF officials,” the spokesperson said as quoted by The Intercept. “The United States was not party to those discussions, though we continue to encourage Pakistan to engage constructively with the IMF on its reform program.”,
,“An IMF spokesperson denied the institution was pressured but did not comment on whether it was taken into confidence about the weapons program,” The Intercept said. ,
,The Intercept said that as it had previously reported that Donald Lu, “the senior State Department official, said in a meeting with then-Pakistani Ambassador Asad Majeed Khan two weeks after the invasion of Ukraine that it was the belief of the US that Pakistan had taken a neutral position solely at Imran Khan’s direction, adding that all would be forgiven if Khan was removed in the no-confidence vote. Since his ouster, Pakistan has firmly taken the side of the US and Ukraine in the war.”,

,Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said the funds, which had been frozen in South Korea, would be in Iran's possession on Monday so the deal mediated by Qatar during months of talks could go ahead.,
,There was no immediate public U.S. comment.,
,""Both parties have been notified by Qatar that all $6 billion has been transferred from Switzerland to bank accounts in Qatar,"" the source briefed on the matter told Reuters.,

Afghanistan And The UAE; “They Are Happy to Help Us More”
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/opinion-182050,"The United Arab Emirates is one of the wealthiest countries in the Persian Gulf region. The caretaker government of the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan stated that they are hoping for a good ecopolitical relationship with the UAE.,
,""The United Arab Emirates' relations with Afghanistan have been tied to economic issues since the relatively distant past,"" said Haji Obaidullah Sader Khail, head of the Afghan business council in the UAE, in an exclusive interview with TOLOnews.,
,""They've been involved in several infrastructural projects in Afghanistan and made several hospitals, universities, schools, and residential buildings across Afghanistan in the Past. They carried on with their projects inside Afghanistan since the new establishment took over,"" he added.,
,After the republic government's collapse and the Islamic Emirate's establishment in Afghanistan, Turkey and Qatar entered a competition to take over the management of Kabul International Airport. Although Qatar is known to influence the new Afghan authorities and tried hard to take over the country's market, according to Obaidullah Sader Khail, it was the United Arab Emirates that finally signed the contract to rebuild and run the international Kabul airport and ""they delivered 80 per cent of what they've promised"".,
,According to Mr Sader Khail, the UAE has never tried to take a side in empowering a specific ethnic group based on cultural or linguistic similarity. ""They don't have any border with us like Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Pakistan do to base their relations on supporting specific agendas,"" Mr Sader Khail added, ""the interests of the United Arab Emirates in Afghanistan are mostly based on common economic interests."",
,Some economic experts believe if the caretaker government of Afghanistan pave the way to establish a solid financial relationship at the macro level with the United Arab Emirates, it will gain sustainable economic benefits.,
,""The UAE is working with different sectors of the acting government of the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan to build 200 hospitals across the country, make roads, publish schools' books, build water channels, improve our saffron production to replace the harvest of opium poppies and carpet industry but they are happy to do more,"" Mr Sader Khail said in his interview with TOlOnews.,
,""The UAE could even help us extract Afghanistan's rich mines,"" said Mr Sader Khail pointing to the rich natural wealth of Afghanistan.,
,The UAE is a vital ally of the west and is known for its extensive diplomatic and commercial relations with most countries worldwide. This country plays an essential role in OPEC and is one of the founding members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council. According to Mr Sader Khail, ""they represent the international community in Afghanistan"".,
,However, the non-recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan by the international community, including the UAE, has caused uncertainty in the relations between Afghanistan and the UAE.,
,For this reason, the high-ranking delegations of the United Arab Emirates government have shown interest in investing in Afghanistan in their recent trip to Afghanistan and meeting with the caretaker government officials. But the internal policies of the current government of Afghanistan, especially the restrictions imposed on women's work and education, have prevented the establishment of such relations between Afghanistan and the world.,
,""Girls cannot go to school. Universities are closed. Girls' schools are closed. Women are not allowed to work. Afghan people themselves are not happy with this situation. I even think many caretaker government members are against these decisions. No one will recognise us when we do not solve these problems,"" said Haji Obaidullah Sader Khail in his interview with TOlOnews. He also mentioned the roles women held in the UAE's government. ""Now, in the world and the United Arab Emirates, half of the government employees are women. Women are half of humanity. Who will recognise you when schools and universities are closed, and women are not allowed to work? The United Arab Emirates is also an Islamic country, and Saudi Arabia is also an Islamic country, but which of these countries has closed girls' schools?"",
,According to Mr Sader Khail, the UAE hosts the largest Afghan business community in the diaspora. More than 300,000 Afghans are living and working in the UAE. ""Now, the majority of Afghan businessmen living in the United Arab Emirates hope that the situation in Afghanistan will develop in such a way that the way for the establishment of extensive trade relations between this country and other countries of the world will be opened."",
,Although the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan called the current government a caretaker government and promised to remove the restrictions imposed on women according to Islamic orders, it is not clear when these measures will be taken and whether they can satisfy the international community and, specifically, the UAE to recognise it or not.  ,

Afghanistan: One Year On
",https://tolonews.comNone,https://tolonews.com/opinion-179601,"A year ago today (28 August), the last UK evacuation flight left Kabul following the Taliban coming to power in Afghanistan.,
,This anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the current situation in Afghanistan and look ahead to the future.,
,Underpinning the UK’s approach is our strong sense of commitment to the Afghan people. While we no longer have a physical presence in Kabul, this bond means that we remain closely engaged in supporting the livelihoods and wellbeing of the Afghan people.,
,Afghans have seen enough conflict over the years, and we want to see a more peaceful and secure future for Afghanistan and the wider region, where everyone is able to live in peace, with their basic needs and rights met.,
,Over the past year, the country has changed dramatically.,
,While there are a number of concerning developments, the fact that there has been a significant reduction in violence and civilian casualties following the end of large-scale conflict is beyond debate. This is positive and should be welcomed.,
,The Afghan people have suffered from conflict for far too long, and further violence will benefit no one.,
,For our part, we have made clear that we do not support the use of violence as a means of pursuing political goals in Afghanistan. But we do regard peaceful political activity not only as legitimate, but also more important than ever.,
,If there is anything the conflict over the past four decades has shown, it is the need to balance the drive for central control with the need to represent the interests of all groups in Afghan society.,
,The greatest immediate challenge that Afghanistan faces is the drastic humanitarian situation and the significant levels of hunger across the country. Over 24 million people – more than half the population – remain in need of humanitarian assistance. Despite all efforts, the number of people in dire need has hardly reduced.,
,The UK is playing a leading role in the international response to this crisis.,
,Last year, there was significant concern at the potential for a humanitarian catastrophe over the winter. The UK, recognising the seriousness of the situation, doubled its aid to Afghanistan, disbursing $347 million.,
,We have pledged the same amount this financial year, and have already distributed $170 million of this funding.,
,This is the UK’s largest bilateral programme of aid anywhere in the world this year.,
,Beyond our national commitment, last March the UK co-hosted a pledging conference with the UN, Qatar and Germany, which raised $2.4 billion in new humanitarian aid.,
,Our strong support was also on display in the devastating aftermath of the earthquake in June in Paktika and Khost provinces. The UK, recognising the need to rally in support of the international response, allocated over $3.5 million to the crisis within a matter of hours.,
,Throughout 2021 and 2022, aid provided by the UK has reached 4.3 million Afghans with emergency humanitarian support for health, water, sanitation and hygiene, protection, shelter, food, livelihoods, and education.,
,However, we also understand that humanitarian assistance alone cannot solve the long-term problems of Afghanistan.,
,Crises across the world, including the war in Ukraine and famine elsewhere, will put additional strain on donor budgets to continue providing humanitarian aid indefinitely.,
,So it is more important than ever to address the underlying economic crisis that is the cause of much of the hunger and poverty in Afghanistan, in order to avoid a continued cycle of humanitarian disaster.,
,The UK understands the importance of broader economic stabilisation and longer-term development support.,
,Here, the Taliban need to help us to help the people of Afghanistan.,
,This need is made all the more important and stark in the aftermath of the discovery of Ayman al-Zawahiri living in downtown Kabul just last month.,
,The international community had been assured consistently over the past year that the Taliban were not harbouring Al-Qaeda leadership. This was proven patently false.,
,Such disregard for key commitments undermines the trust needed to work together on shared interests and makes it even more difficult to consider lifting sanctions..,
,The UK does not propose to lecture or impose its values on others – but there are some fundamental principles that are universal, necessary and also pragmatic.,
,This latest development comes in the context of a trajectory of decisions around human rights by the Taliban, including on women and girls in particular.,
,The decision on 23 March 2022 not to allow girls to attend secondary school is of course totemic for the international community. Empowering women through education and equality is the key to unlocking the country’s future potential.,
,This is not a ‘western’ perspective. There are many Islamic states where women and girls participate fully in society, contributing to their countries’ success and prosperity.,
,As set out in the UN human rights report last month, there are significant concerns across the human rights spectrum that it will be important to make tangible progress on.,
,The UK wants to continue to work pragmatically to support a positive future for Afghanistan.,
,We are willing to work together pragmatically, and to put historic differences to one side. We are willing to do so for the benefit of the Afghan people, who have been through so much for so long.,
,But we cannot move faster than the Taliban’s actions allow.,
,I say this because I believe that engagement with the Taliban is essential to build common approaches to resolving the problems afflicting the people of Afghanistan.,
,In order to be accepted as a legitimate member of the international community, it is crucial for the Taliban to adhere to key commitments made to the international community, and to build trust.,
,The shared expectations of the entire international community were set out in the UN Security Council Resolution 2593 of 30 August 2021 and in a number of subsequent resolutions.,
,I am proud to serve as Chargé d’Affaires for the UK’s Mission to Afghanistan.,
,Our Mission and Government continue to work tirelessly in the hope that we will be able to take positive, tangible steps to bring Afghanistan increasingly back into the international community.,
,After decades of war and conflict, I remain optimistic about the potential for Afghanistan. Not out of a misplaced idealism, but out of an abiding faith in the strength, fortitude, ingenuity and resilience of the Afghan people.,
,One thing is certain: the UK is committed to taking this journey with and in support of the people of Afghanistan, now and for many years to come.,
